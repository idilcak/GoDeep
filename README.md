# GoDeep


concerns atm:
1. Saving
2. Gradients do not exist (but it does seem to be learning, one time it very clearly converged to not playing ;))
    a. it is not clear whether there is something wrong with the MCTS or whether it does not think it can do better than 50%?
    b. I want to test some of the game results, see if white is always winning
    c. Not sure how to fix the convering to not playing problem
3. The Label generation process is what takes forever (which makes sense but this long?!)

TODO:
2. resignation system ?
3. shuffling
4. one fewer game per set?
